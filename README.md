# PCA-Application-in-Data-Analysis

## Description

This project explores the application of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset containing 1000 features to just 2 features. The primary goal is to uncover patterns and relationships within the data, making it more visually understandable to further analysis.

## Motivation

Working with high-dimensional datasets can be challenging when trying to discover meaningful patterns and relationships. This project was motivated by the need to simplify the data for improved visualization and insight. By reducing the dimensionality of the dataset to just 2 features, we aim to make the data more accessible and to identify any hidden structures or clusters.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is named `toy_dataset.csv`. This dataset is provided in CSV format and contains valuable information for our analysis.

### Data Exploration

For a detailed exploration of the dataset, refer to the Jupyter notebook in this repository, where we apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the data, making it more accessible and conducive to further analysis.

This project and dataset is inspired by a course on Coursera taught by Andrew Ng
